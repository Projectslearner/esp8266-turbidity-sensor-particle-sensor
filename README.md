### ESP8266 Turbidity Sensor Particle Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
This project showcases how to use an ESP8266 microcontroller to interface with a turbidity sensor (particle sensor) to monitor water clarity. Turbidity sensors are essential in applications where water quality assessment is crucial, such as environmental monitoring and water treatment systems.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Turbidity Sensor (Particle Sensor)**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**
- **Power Supply**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Turbidity Sensor to ESP8266:**
   - Connect the analog output pin of the turbidity sensor to analog pin A0 on the ESP8266.
   - Ensure a common ground (GND) connection between the ESP8266 and the turbidity sensor.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 for debugging purposes.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Read the analog value from the turbidity sensor using `analogRead(turbiditySensorPin)`.
     - Print the turbidity value to the Serial Monitor.
     - Compare the turbidity value with a predefined threshold (`turbidityThreshold`).
     - If the turbidity value exceeds the threshold, print "Water is dirty!" to indicate poor water clarity.
     - If the turbidity value is below the threshold, print "Water is clean." to indicate good water clarity.
     - Add a delay (`delay(1000)`) between readings to avoid rapid sensor data fluctuations.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Threshold Adjustment:** Modify `turbidityThreshold` based on sensor calibration to accurately detect water clarity levels.
   - **Sensor Placement:** Ensure proper positioning of the turbidity sensor in the water sample for accurate readings.
   - **Power Supply:** Provide stable power to both ESP8266 and the turbidity sensor for reliable operation.

#### Applications
- **Water Quality Monitoring:** Assess water clarity in environmental monitoring projects.
- **Aquariums and Fish Tanks:** Monitor water quality to maintain a healthy aquatic environment.
- **Industrial Applications:** Ensure process water quality in manufacturing and production facilities.

#### Notes
- **Calibration:** Calibration of the turbidity sensor may be necessary to ensure accurate readings.
- **Serial Output:** Utilize the Serial Monitor to observe and debug turbidity sensor readings and operations.
